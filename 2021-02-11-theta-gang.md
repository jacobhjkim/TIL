# Theta Gang
Theta Gang is the slang for being a member of a group of other option writers with the mindset that selling premium is a preferred strategy than buying options. They are short Theta by selling option contracts as their strategy to profit from option buyers as time value decays and the option eventually expires worthless. Common Theta Gang strategies focus on lower risk profile option selling strategies that have hedges for capped risk. 

Theta Gang option strategies donâ€™t try to predict the future price of a stock, they try to project where the price of a stock is not going to go before the expiration date of short options. Theta Gang strategies try to profit by playing the time game by running out the clock on option buyers. They go short Theta by selling premium and make money each day that price does not move in favor of the strike price of their short options. 

There are many option strategies for being short Theta with a hedge but here are three of the most popular and easy to understand.
