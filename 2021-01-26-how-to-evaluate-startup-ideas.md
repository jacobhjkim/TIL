# How to Evaluate Startup Idea?

First of all,
> startup == growth

### Problem:
Is the problem popular?
- Obviously, it would be better if a lot of people are suffering from the same problem I am trying to solve.

Is the problem 
- Growing?: 1M+
- Urgent?: Market growing 20%/year
- Expensive? $B total adjustable market
- Mandatory? Needs to be solved right now
- Frequent? multiple times a day (Slack)

### Solution:
Don’t start from the Solution
Solution In Search of a Problem (SISP). Avoid SISP!
Don’t shoe hole your solution to the problem. Always think about the problem first.

### Insight:
Unfair advantage:
- Why are you going to win over anyone else?
- related to growth

**Types of Unfair advantages:**
- Founders: Ph.D. in that field, or etc
- Market: Is the market expanding really fast (weakest advantage overall)
- Product: Do you have a 10x better product?
- Acquisition: Can you get free users (i.e. network effects)?
- Monopoly: Can you make sure your competitors can’t overtake what you have achieved?
