# Data Oriented Programming

I learned about this cool concept called data-oriented programming today.
And I am not educated enough to explan the concept of DOP better than these two articles I found on Hacker News.

- [data-oriented-python](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/data_oriented_python/)
- [data-oriented-rust](http://jamesmcm.github.io/blog/2020/07/25/intro-dod/)

I wonder how I can apply this school of thought to data engineering.
