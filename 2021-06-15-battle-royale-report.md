# Battle Royale in Online & Mobile Gaming [A deep dive into why momentum will build]

>  In this report, we share our thoughts on several aspects of the genre and opportunities prior to the listing of Krafton (expected to be 3Q20E), the developer of global leading Battle Royale game, PUBG.

Sustainable revenue trends expected
> In fact, Fortnite’s annual ARPU is estimated at US$102, while at flagship Korean MMORPGs it hovers around US$1,000.

>As seen in Fig 18, top Battle Royale titles recorded download figures which can be compared to those of Puzzle games that have advantages of over other genres in terms of user acquisition thanks to simplicity. Such figures indicate that the genre has very low entry barriers for users despite seemingly difficult game play. We believe the strong user acquisition of Battle Royale is attributable to its intuitive game style, short playtime for each session, and less demanding business model.


> PUBG Mobile’s ARPU of US$28 seems accessible in many countries, given that it is substantially lower than hardcore MMORPGs (i.e Lineage M’s ARPU in Korea is estimated to be US$1,040/year). 

> We believe ARPU for key Battle Royale titles can continue to go up. As purchasing in-game items is not mandatory and does not affect the actual gaming experience, rising loyalty for the game should naturally raise spending on the game. We have seen from other platforms such as AfreecaTV Co (067160 KS, Won108,200, Outperform, TP: Won120,000, Andy Kim) that users tend to spend more as they use the service for a longer period

> In addition, given the pre-registration figure of Krafton’s new game, PUBG New State, Battle Royale is gaining popularity in all regions. The game aggregated more than 10 million pre-registered users only 43 days after the start of the event.
